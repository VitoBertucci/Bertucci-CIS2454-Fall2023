        <h1>1 - Name, and major / reason for taking the class</h1>
        <h3>
            My name is Vito Bertucci and I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my
            program and because I am looking to get into frontend development
        </h3>
        <h1>2 - Any previous programming experience that they have</h1>
        <h3>
            This is my third year of taking computer science classes and I have taken classes in
            Java, C#, C++, database management, networking, SQL, data structures, and I am also currently
            taking an HTML class. Outside of school I have created different projects in Java and Python
            in order to make my work flow better, and I have completed some bootcamp stuff in Javascript,
            HTML, and CSS. I have also started to get into different frameworks like React.js.
        </h3>
        <h1>3 - Do they have any hobbies?</h1>
        <h3>
            I really enjoy golf, I played over 2,000 holes of golf last season,which is roughly 25
            holes of golf, everyday, for 3 months straight. I also enjoy playing guitar and have been
            playing for 12 years now, I was even once a teacher with students.
        </h3>
        <h1>4 - Do they have any plans for the Fall aside from school?</h1>
        <h3>
            This fall I am planning on heading up north at some point with my girlfriend for a camping
            trip. We are thinking about Pictured Rocks or somewhere in the Upper Peninsula. I also, of
            course, am planning on playing a bunch of golf, because I love fall golf.
        </h3>
        <h1>5 - Anything else they'd like the class to know about them.</h1>
        <h3>
            I am excited to learn new things this semester because almost all of my previous classes
            have been in Java or some sort of C language, and I am not super comfortable with HTML yet
            so I am excited to get out of that comfort zone.
